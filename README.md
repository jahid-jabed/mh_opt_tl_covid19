  - `collect_Data()`
    * This function used to collect data based on the classes (folders, each folder represent a class in dataset folder) from given drive path.
  - Pickle
    * Pickle is used for store and retrive data from given drive path.
  - `train_test_split(...)
    * Used for data spliting for cross validation during training.
  - `display_multiple_img(...)`
    * Used for display some random data images with thier classes.
  - `train(...), compile(...), fit(...), ...` etc
    * Used for training the model and performance measures.
  - `initial_individuals(model)`
    * Used for initialization of unique individual for the initial population.
  - `mutate(individual, model)`
    * Used for mutation of `individual` with a mutation factor and provide unique gene.
  - `crossover(individuals, model)`
    * Used for crossover operation on a population (`individuals`) and provide unique `individual` in population using uniform crossover.
